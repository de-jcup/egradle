    <description> 
 Thrown when the tooling API client attempts to use a method that does not exist 
 in the version of Gradle that the tooling API is connected to. 
 &lt;p&gt; 
 Typically, to resolve such a problem you change/upgrade the target version of Gradle that 
 the tooling API is connected to. Alternatively, you can handle and ignore this exception.
