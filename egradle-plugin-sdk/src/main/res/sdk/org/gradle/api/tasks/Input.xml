    <description>
 * &lt;p&gt;Attached to a task property to indicate that the property specifies some input value for the task.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This annotation should be attached to the getter method or the field for the property.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This will cause the task to be considered out-of-date when the property has changed. When used on a
 * {@link java.io.File} object that refers to a file or directory, the up-to-date check is only dependent on the
 * path and not the contents of the file or directory. To make it depend on the contents, use
 * {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.InputFile} or {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.InputDirectory} respectively.
