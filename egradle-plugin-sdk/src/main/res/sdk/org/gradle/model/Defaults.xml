 * Denotes that the {@link RuleSource} method rule carrying this annotation initializes the rule subject with default values.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Default rules execute first for a given subject, just after the subject has been created but before {@link Model} rules and {@link Mutate} rules.
 * The first parameter of the rule is the rule subject, which is mutable for the duration of the rule.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Please see {@link RuleSource} for more information on method rules.
