    <method name="getOutput" returnType="java.lang.String" delegationTarget="">
        <description> 
 The textual output produced during the build. 
 &lt;p&gt; 
 This is equivalent to the console output produced when running a build from the command line. 
 It contains both the standard output, and standard error output, of the build. 
 
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b class='return'&gt;returns:&lt;/b&gt;the build output, or an empty string if there was no build output (e.g. ran with &lt;a href='type://-q'&gt;-q&lt;/a&gt;)

    <method name="getTasks" returnType="java.util.List">
        <description> 
 The tasks that were part of the build. 
 &lt;p&gt; 
 The order of the tasks corresponds to the order in which the tasks were started. 
 If executing a parallel enabled build, the order is not guaranteed to be deterministic. 
 &lt;p&gt; 
 The returned list is an unmodifiable view of items. 
 The returned list will be empty if no tasks were executed. 
 This can occur if the build fails early, due to a build script failing to compile for example.
