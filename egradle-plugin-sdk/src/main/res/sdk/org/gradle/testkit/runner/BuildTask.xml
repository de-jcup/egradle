     * The unique path of the task.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The task path is a combination of its enclosing project's path and its name.
     * For example, in multi project build the {@code bar} task of the {@code foo} project has a path of {@code :foo:bar}.
     * In a single project build, the {@code bar} task of the lone project has a path of {@code :bar}.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This value corresponds to the value output by Gradle for the task during its normal progress logging.
