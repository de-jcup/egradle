# README


## About
The files inside this folder were generated by the
"New project wizard" of https://github.com/de-jcup/egradle/[EGradle] eclipse plugin.
 
 This is a small initial setup for 
technical project documentation. 

 

[NOTE]
====
If you want to document your architecture, you could use
the `arc42` asciidoctor template - it's free!  
You can download from: https://arc42.org/download .
====

## How to generate the output
Just execute `gradlew asciidoctor` and you will get PDF and also HTML output in build folders:

- techdoc.pdf
- techdoc.html
- operations.pdf
- operations.html

You can also use https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/asciidoctor-editor + 
to edit these files in a WYSIWYG way.
