==== Documentation

===== Why you should use asciidoc
You should use a text base markup language like `asciidoc`
to write your documentation - and have it inside same
repository as rest of your code. 

So you got documentation as code...

TIP: Please look at 
      http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference for quick introduction into asciidoctor syntax.

===== Setup
When using Egradle you just have to use the `New project wizard`and select
the `full multi project with asciidoctor` template to have a full working setup.

Otherwise please look at https://arc42.org where you can find very good templates in `asciidoc` format.
