<title>About code completion package</title>
</head>
<body>
	Code completion shall be testable and easy implemented. To handle  this, each part of the 
	code completion provided by EGradle Editor will be 
	<ul>
		<li>Inside this package</li>
		<li>Have its own XYZProposalFactory implementation</li>
	</ul>
	Why specialized proposal factories? So each factory is only responsible for a dedicated part of proposal.
	So its much easier to write, read, maintain and -last but not least- easy to test.
