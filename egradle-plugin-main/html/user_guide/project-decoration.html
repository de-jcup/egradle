	<h1>Project decoration</h1>
	<h2>Mark projects</h2>
	Projects where the set gradle root project folder is the parent are
	marked with an EGradle icon:
	<br>
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-project-decoration.png" />
	</p>
	<h2>Change root project in preferences</h2>
	When you change your root project the markers will be updated.
	<h2>Problem marker overlay</h2>
	Remark: Maybe the problem marker is a little bit difficult to see on
	the marked projects but there is still the "Problems"-View in eclipse
	where you can see it much more better.
