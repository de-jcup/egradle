	<h2 id="concept">About the concept</h2>
	<p>Inside a gradle root project you have got at least
	<ul>
		<li>build.gradle</li>
		<li>gradle.properties</li>
		<li>settings.gradle</li>
		<li>sub projects</li>
		<li><i>maybe additional folders</i></li>
		<li><i>maybe additional files</i></li>
	</ul>

	So how can we work with root project content? We have got following
	possibilities:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Import the root project as an eclipse project</b> and have
			all resource duplicated in "Search", "Open Type", have wrong links to
			parts not natured/parsed etc.<i>(inconvenient + slow + problems)</i>
		</li>
		<li>Do not import the root project as an eclipse project but <b>open
				content in external editors</b> instead <i>(inconvenient)</i>
		</li>
		<li>Last but not least you can <b>create a temporary project,
				create linked files and linked folders</b> to the parts you want to have
			<i>(very much of work)</i>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I preferred the temporary project approach but I didn't like the
		manual work to create links etc... So what about having this been done
		automatically?</p>

	<p>This is exact what the so called "Virtual root project" does: By
		clicking a button inside the EGradle toolbar you are able to
		(re-)create a "Virtual root project" of your current set gradle root
		project. The virtual root project will contain all folders and files
		of gradle root project folder being not already imported as an eclipse
		project into current workspace.</p>
	<br/><br/>
	<h2 id="example">An example</h2>
	There is a root project folder given called "test-rootproject". It's
	content looks like shown in next image:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-explorer.png" />
	</p>
	The both projects were already imported into eclipse workspace:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-before-click.png" />
	</p>
	After clicking the red marked toolbar button the virtual root project
	shows up. It contains NOT the both already imported projects but only
	the missing stuff:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-after-click.png" />
	</p>
	If you delete e.g. "testproject1" (without content delete!) and press
	the toolbar button again, the "testproject1" sub folder will be shown
	again inside the virtual root project.

	<h2 id="refresh">How to update/refresh project</h2>
	<h3>Normal refresh</h3>
	Like a normal project, you can use F5 to refresh the project.
	<h3 id="recreated">Full recreate</h3>
	<p>
		<table border='0'>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-recreate.png" /></td>
			<td>A simple click to the button does recreate it again from
		scratch. At doing this current already opened/imported gradle projects
		are recognized again.</td>
		</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info.png"/></td>
				<td>If your team provider does not automatically connect the project to
		your SCM you have to <a href="#share_project">connect it</a> again.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</p>
	
	<br/><br/>
	<h2 id="remove">How to remove the virtual root project</h2>
	Select the project and press DEL as you would do on any other project.
	You can also check the 'delete content' check box.
	<br/><br/>
	<h2 id="change_root_project">Changing the root project in
		preferences</h2>
	If the virtual root project is inside workspace it will be
	automatically <a href="#recreated">re-created</a>
	<br/><br/>
	<h2 id="share_project">Version control (SCM)</h2>
	<h3>GIT</h3>
	When you call "Team - share Project..." on the virtual root project you
	are able to <b>connect it with your GIT repository</b> like any other eclipse project
	<br> The GIT team provider decorations and the GIT staging is done
	as usual.
	<br/><br/>
	<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>
	The files <i>.gitignore</i> and <i>.project</i> are NOT from root folder but from virtual root project itself!
	If you want to change /commit these two root folder files you must do the changes outside eclipse.
