	<h2 id="concept">About the concept</h2>
	<p>Inside a gradle root project you have got at least
	<ul>
		<li>build.gradle</li>
		<li>gradle.properties</li>
		<li>settings.gradle</li>
		<li>subprojects</li>
		<li><i>maybe additional folders</i></li>
		<li><i>maybe additional files</i></li>
	</ul>

	So how can we work with root project content? We have got following
	possibilities:
	<ol>
		<li><b>Import the root project as an eclipse project</b> and have
			all resource duplicated in "Search", "Open Type", have wrong links to
			parts not natured/parsed etc.<i>(inconvenient + slow + problems)</i>
		</li>
		<li>Do not import the root project as an eclipse project but <b>open
				content in external editors</b> instead <i>(inconvenient)</i>
		</li>
		<li>Last but not least you can <b>create a temporary project,
				create linked files and linked folders</b> to the parts you want to have
			<i>(very much of work)</i>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>I preferred the temporary project approach but I didn't like the
		manual work to create links etc... So what about having this been done
		automatically?</p>

	<p>This is exact what the so called "Virtual root project" does: By
		clicking a button inside the EGradle toolbar you are able to
		(re-)create a "Virtual root project" of your current set gradle
		rootproject. The virtual root project will contain all folders and
		files of gradle root project folder being not already imported as an
		eclipse project into current workspace.</p>
	<h2 id="example">An example</h2>
	There is a root project folder given called "test-rootproject". It's
	content looks like shown in next image:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-explorer.png" />
	</p>
	The both projects were already imported into eclipse workspace:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-before-click.png" />
	</p>
	After clicking the red marked toolbar button the virtual root project
	shows up. It contains NOT the both already imported projects but only
	the missing stuff:
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-virtualrootproject-example-after-click.png" />
	</p>
	If you delete e.g. "testproject1" (without content delete!) and press
	the toolbar button again, the "testproject1" subfolder will be shown
	again inside the virtual root project.

	<h2 id="update">How to update/refresh project</h2>
	Of course you can use F5 to refresh the project. But a simple click to
	the button does recreate it again from scratch - and with already
	opened/imported gradle project recognition.

	<h2 id="remove">How to remove the virtual root project</h2>
	Select the project and press DEL as you would do on any other project

	<h2 id="change_root_project">Changing the root project in
		preferences</h2>
	If the virtual root project is inside workspace it will be
	automatically refreshed
