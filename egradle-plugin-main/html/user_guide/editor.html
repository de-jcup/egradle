	<h1>EGradle editor</h1>
	<p>
		With version 1.3 the EGradle editor icon changed from original
		gradle icon <img src="images/gradle-og.png" /> to <img
			src="images/gradle-editor.png" />. <br> This was done to differ
		from gradle execution parts and also from other editors. Some older
		documentation parts still showing the old image as editor icon,
		so please be not confused. New screenshots will always contain the new
		icon.
	</p>
	<p>The editor has following features:

	<h2 id="outline">Outline view</h2>
	<h3>Open outline view</h3>
	<p>Open a gradle build file with the EGradle editor. If the outline
		view is already active it will appear automatically, otherwise
		activate the view:</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse-show-outline-view.png" />
	<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Content</h3>
	<p>The outline view will give you a reduced view of your current
		gradle build file.</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-outline.png" />
	<h4>Link with Editor</h4>
	<p>The outline view can be linked with Editor. In the left picture
		you see a linked outline. When you click on the red circled button it
		will change to the purple circled version and the editor is no more
		linked with the outline.</p>
	<p>A linked outline will correspond on editor caret changes and
		also set caret and selection if user selects a position inside outline
		view by one single click.</p>
	<p>An unlinked outline has still the ability to select parts of
		editor - a double click to outline item will do the selection too.</p>
	<table border='0'>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/egradle-editor-outline-linked.png" /></td>
			<td><img src="images/egradle-editor-outline-unlinked.png" /></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h5>Link preferences</h5>
	<p>
		Inside editor preferences you are able to setup the default link
		behavior of new opened outlines.<br /> Enable or disable the checkbox
		labeled with "New opened editors are linked with outline"
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-preferences-outline-link-default.png" />

	</p>


	<h2 id="quick_outline">Quick Outline</h2>
	<h3>Open quick outline</h3>
	<p>Press CTRL + O when you are inside EGradle editor and the quick
		outline dialog appears. Selected is tree item next to your cursor
		position inside editor:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-quick-outline-1.png" />
	<br />
	<br />
	<h3>Keyboard usage</h3>
	<p>When you press CURSOR DOWN inside input field, you will switch
		to current selected outline tree item. Now you can move around with
		cursor keys inside outline tree. When you press ENTER the dialog
		closes and your former selection is selected in editor. When you press
		ESC the dialog will close without any further action.</p>
	<h3>Content</h3>
	<p>
		Content is same as described in <a href="#outline">Outline View</a>.
		But the quick outline does not need a view to be visible, you can also
		filter for wanted parts. <br> <br> An example: you want to
		show all parts starting with "lib", so you simply type "lib" and the
		tree shows only leaves starting with lib.
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-quick-outline-2.png" />
	<p>You can also use wildcards for filtering. The location of the
		quick outline dialog can be moved, resized and remembered. To change
		the behaviour open the menu as described in next picture.</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-quick-outline-3.png" />

	<p>

	</p>
	<h2 id="code_assistance">Code assistance</h2>
	<p>The editor contains a basic code completion and tooltip support.
		Basic, because
	<ul>
		<li>there are still many things to improve</li>
		<li>many features known from Java editor code completion are
			still missing.</li>
		<li>dynamic delegation targets like <pre>
	configure(something){
		/* at this time EGradle editor does not know what something is...*/
	}
</pre> cannot be resolved currently.
		</li>
	</ul>
	The included EGradle SDK plugin supports always only one version. You
	find more information about SDK and its content at
	<a href='#codeassist_preferences'>code assistant preferences</a>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="code_completion">Code completion</h3>
	<p>In next picture cursor is at line 2 and
	<pre>CTRL + SPACE</pre>
	is pressed. The code completion appears:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-1.png" />
	<p>
		As you can see there are many suggestions. <br> Because its very
		difficult to handle the correct applied plugin in every context,
		EGradle will always suggest any known action from all potential
		plugins. So even when you not have applied one.<br> <br>
		Simply look at the tooltips and proposal texts when you got problems -
		there is normally always an information there when you need a plugin
		to apply before.
	</p>
	<p>When you have entered already parts or you start typing while
		proposals are shown, the content will be filtered:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-2.png" />
	<p>Your entered code must not be the start of the proposals - at
		the next image "project" is entered and user gets also "allProjects"
		for example:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-3.png" />
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="code_tooltips">Code tooltips</h2>
	<p>
		When you hoover in editor at parts which are visible in outline view
		you got a tooltip appearing describing the current method call
		property etc.<br> <br> The next image shows the tooltip
		which appears when your mouse is at line 32 over "task":

	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-tooltip-1.png" />
	<p>
		As you can see the new defined task "myJavaDoc", which is of type
		JavaDoc, is described in tooltip.<br> <br> When you click on
		the green "Go to appendix" link you will see following:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-tooltip-2.png" />
	<p>
		In the picture above the tooltip window has scrolled to Appendix which
		contains estimated Links to gradle DSL and gradle API.<br>When
		you press now the "Link to online gradle DSL documentation" link the
		gradle DSL documentation page is rendered inside the tooltip window:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-tooltip-3.png" />
	<p>If its too small to read, or you want to search etc. you can
		simply press the red marked button and the site will be opened inside
		your system web browser:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-code-assist-tooltip-4.png" />
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="codeassist_preferences">Code assistance preferences</h2>
	<p>Code assistance has following preferences:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-preferences-codeassist.png" />
	<p>
		You can turn off/on code proposals and tooltips here. <br> <br>Also
		a "SDK information" group is visible: <br> It shows the version
		of SDK plugin and some extra informatio like supported gradle version
		and local SDK installation time. The SDK version numbering is bound
		with supported gradle version. So a "<b>3.0</b>.0" means, that the SDK
		contains support for gradle <b>3.0</b> and has its internal version
		"0".<br> <br> When SDK support additional plugins - e.g.
		"android" - you will find this information here in future.

	</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>
	<h2 id="parse_failures">Show parse failures</h2>
	<p>EGradle editor will automatically parse the opened gradle file
		and mark all parse errors. In next image a closing bracket is missing:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-parser-error.png" />
	<p>The errors will be persisted and remain until parse errors are
		resolved.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="bracket_switching">Bracket switching</h2>
	<p>EGradle editor supports bracket switching and rendering. In next
		picture the cursor is behind curly bracket in line 7 so its
		corresponding part in line 11 is rendered.</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-bracket-switching-1.png" />
	<p>When pressing CTRL + SHIFT + P the cursor moves to corresponding
		curly bracket in line 11 and line 7 is rendered as corresponding part:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-bracket-switching-2.png" />
	<p>When pressing CTRL + SHIFT + P again the cursor moves back to
		line 7.</p>
	<h3>Bracket switching preferences</h3>
	<p>Inside editor preferences you are able to setup the bracket
		switching behaviour:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-preferences-bracket-highlighting.png" />

	<br />
	<br />

	<p>

	<h2 id="bracket_auto_create_ending_bracket">Auto create ending
		bracket</h2>
	<p>EGradle editor supports automatic bracket closing for curly
		brackets. In next picture the cursor is behind entered text
		"dependencies":</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-auto-create-ending-brackets-1.png" />
	<p>When pressing { the closing curly bracket will be automatically
		added. The cursor remains after opening bracket:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-auto-create-ending-brackets-2.png" />
	<h3>Bracket closing preferences</h3>
	<p>Inside editor preferences you are able to enable/disable auto
		creation of ending brackets:</p>
	<img
		src="images/egradle-editor-preferences-auto-create-ending-brackets.png" />

	<h2 id="block_commenting">Block commenting</h2>
	<p>EGradle editor supports block commenting. In next picture parts
		of two lines (3-4) are selected:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-toggle-comments-1.png" />
	<p>When pressing CTRL + 7 both lines are transformed to single line
		comments:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-toggle-comments-2.png" />
	<p>When pressing CTRL + 7 again lines will loose their comments:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-editor-toggle-comments-3.png" />

	<h2 id="hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</h2>
	<h3 id="link_to_urls">Open URL by text links</h3>
	<p>
		URLs can be opened by pressing CTRL and hoover over a text part inside
		gradle editor where a URL is available. Works same way as described
		for <a href="#link_to_gradle_files">linking gradle files</a> but will
		open the URL with system browser.
	</p>

	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>
	<h3 id="link_to_gradle_files">Open other gradle files by text
		links</h3>
	<p>EGradle editor is able to open other gradle files by supporting
		hyperlink mechanism: Simply press CTRL and hoover over a text where a
		gradle file is mentioned:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-link-to-gradle-files-1.png" />
	<p>On clicking to given hyperlink the other gradle file is opened -
		the example file contains a comment which links to "build.gradle" back
		so it can also be used as an hyperlink:</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-link-to-gradle-files-2.png" />
	<h4>Variable resolving</h4>
	<p>
		As seen in first picture above the variable
		<code>${rootProject.projectDir}</code>
		is automatically resolved. Currently the EGradle IDE only supports
		this variable. <br> If the file is not available given inside
		"link" there is no hyperlinking.
	</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>

	<h3 id="link_to_potential_groovy_java_files">Open Groovy or Java
		types</h3>
	<p>
		Simply press CTRL and hoover over a text where a Groovy or Java type
		is mentioned. On clicking to given hyperlink the editor will try to
		identify your select as an imported java type. <br>
		<br>If it is resolvable by JDT the corresponding Java type will
		be opened in JavaEditor directly. If it's is not resolvable by
		classpath, but there are resources containing this name found, a special resource
		dialog will appear where you can select one of the found results and
		open it with dedicated editor:
	</p>
	<img
		src="images/egradle-editor-link-to-potential-groovy-gradle-java-resource.png" />
	<p>If no resource is found the dialog will have no results.</p>
