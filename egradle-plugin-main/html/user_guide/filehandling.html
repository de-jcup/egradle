	<h2 id="automatically_derive_buildfolders">Automatically derive build folders</h2>
	<p>Inside file handling preferences you can turn on the automatical derive of builder folders - it's turned off per default:</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse-filehandling-preferences.png" />
	<h3>Example</h3>
	<h4>Build folders not set to "derived"</h4>
	<p>When you have not enabled the feature, you will have build resources inside search results and
	also inside your "Open Resource" dialog appearing (see next picture). Sometimes this is very
	inconvenient, e.g. when you accidently edit a HTML file in build instead of source...<p>

	<h4>Build folders automatically set to "derived"</h4>
	<p>By enabling the feature in preferences, every call of <a href="refresh_complete_workspace.html">Refresh eclipse dependencies</a> and also
	<a href="import.html">EGradle imports</a> will automatically set gradle build folders as "derived" which will
	change the results:</p>
	<img src="images/eclipse-filehandling-auto-derive-on.png" />
	<h4>How does it work / how can I change this to former behaviour?"</h4>
	<p>EGradle does only set "derived" to gradle build folders. You could change this in folder properties manually:</p>
