	<h2 id="import_preconditions">Preconditions</h2>
	 EGradle does no magic to your build files. You have to apply the 'eclipse' plugin inside your build.gradle file.

	<h2 id="import_by_importer">Import gradle root and all subprojects by EGradle importer</h2>
	<p>EGradle contains an importer - simply call ""File->Import..." and enter "gradle"</p>

	<p>The settings for gradle root project path, global java home
		settings and gradle call type are initially copied from current
		preferences - if there exists a setup.</p>
	<h3 id="import_by_importer_what_happens">What happens?</h3>
	What happens when you call finish button?
	<ol>
		<li>All eclipse projects which are representatives of the new gradle root project location are closed</li>
		<li>A gradle call "cleanEclipse elcipse" is executed</li>
		<li>If the gradle call is sucessful:
			<ol>
				<li>Old subprojects are deleted (without content)</li>
				<li>Old <a href="virtual_root_project.html">Virtual root project</a> is removed</li>
				<li>The new generated eclipse sub projects are imported into workspace</li>
				<li>
				If the root project is a multi project, 
				a new <a href="virtual_root_project.html">Virtual root project</a> will be created, if it's just a single gradle project 
				no virtual root project is created (because unnecessary - all stuff is inside single project itself)
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If the gradle call was NOT sucessful the former operations are undo'ed:
			<ol>
				<li>The former closed projects will be reopened</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="import_by_importer_reimport">Reimporting current root project</h3>
	What happens when you keep the settings of current preferences?<br><br>	
	The same as described above. But when do you need this? When you switch between branches
	it can happen that you renamed projects, added or deleted projects etc. The branch switch will
	leave "zombie" projects or new projects (which maybe are referenced) are not in workspace. The 
	import process with same settings will all do this automatically...

		After <a href="setup.html">Setup</a> is done for your root project,
		you can use either
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>EGradles<a href="refresh_complete_workspace.html">
				refresh eclipse</a> dependencies button or
		</li>
		<li>use a console of your choice and call inside root project the
			gradle task "eclipse".</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		After this is done, use "File - import ... existing projects"
		inside eclipse and import all projects from root folder.</p>
