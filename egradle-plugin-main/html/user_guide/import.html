	<h1>Import gradle projects</h1>
	<p>You can import projects in different ways, all are working:</p>
	<ul>

		<li><a href="#import_existing">Import existing gradle projects</a>
			<ul>

	</ul>
	<h2 id="new_projects">New projects</h2>
	When you want to start a new gradle project you should use the <code>EGradle New Project Wizard</code>
	which is described <a href="new_project_wizard.html">here</a>. It is the easiest way to 
	create new gradle projects out of the box in eclipse and automatically import them. Of course you are able to create file structure and build files etc. manually and import as existing project(s) as described
	in the next steps.</>
	<h2 id="import_by_importer">Import existing gradle projects</h2>
	<h3 id="import_preconditions">Preconditions</h3>
	 EGradle does no magic to your build files. You have to apply the 'eclipse' plugin inside your build.gradle file.

	<h3 id="import_by_importer">Import gradle root and all subprojects by EGradle importer</h3>
	<p>EGradle contains an importer - simply call "File->Import..." and enter "gradle"</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/egradle-import-rootproject-wizard.png" />
	</p>
	<p>The settings for gradle root project path, global java home
		settings and gradle call type are initially copied from current
		preferences - if there exists a setup.</p>
	<h4 id="import_by_importer_what_happens">What happens?</h4>
	What happens when you call finish button?
	<ol>
		<li>All eclipse projects which are representatives of the new gradle root project location are closed</li>
		<li>A gradle call "cleanEclipse eclipse" is executed</li>
		<li>If the gradle call is sucessful:
			<ol>
				<li>Auto build will be temporary deactivated if enabled</li>
				<li>Old subprojects are deleted (without content)</li>
				<li>Old <a href="virtual_root_project.html">Virtual root project</a> (if existing) is removed</li>
				<li>The new generated eclipse sub projects are imported into workspace</li>
				<li>Assemble task will be executed - so build folders do exist <i>(except when deactivated in preferences)</i>i></li>
				<li>Eclipse projects are refreshed</li>
				<li>Full clean build is executed for all projects inside eclipse<i>(except when deactivated in preferences)</i>i></li>
				<li>Gradle build folders are automatically derived if <a href="filehandling.html#automatically_derive_buildfolders">derive
				feature</a> is enabled in preferences
				<li>When auto build was enabled before import, auto build will be reactivated</li>
		</li>
				<li>
				If the root project is a multi project, 
				a new <a href="virtual_root_project.html">Virtual root project</a> will be created, if it's just a single gradle project 
				no virtual root project is created (because unnecessary - all stuff is inside single project itself)
				</li>
				<li>Your entered values are used as new preferences for EGradle</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If the gradle call was NOT sucessful the former operations are undo'ed:
			<ol>
				<li>The former closed projects will be reopened</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h4 id="import_by_importer_reimport">Reimporting current root project</h4>
	<p>
	What happens when you keep the settings of current preferences?<br><br>	
	The same as described above. But when do you need this? When you switch between branches
	it can happen that you renamed projects, added or deleted projects etc. The branch switch will
	leave "zombie" projects or new projects (which maybe are referenced) are not in workspace. The 
	import process with same settings will all do this automatically...
	</p>
	<p>
	There exists a convenient action for this use case: In every project associated with current gradle root project inside
	context menu you got the import action:  
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-import-context-menu.png" />
	<p>
		<a href="#top">Top</a>
	</p>	
	<h4 id="import_preferences">Import preferences</h4>
	<p>
	The importer has got it's own preferences page where you can setup
	some behaviour:
	</p>
	<img src="images/egradle-preferences-importer.png" />
	<p>
	<h5>Execute assemble task</h5>
	When this option is enabled, the <b>assemble</b> task will be called after 
	EGradle has imported the projects into eclipse. This will build
	main output and build folders but no test outputs.<br><br>
	If you deactivate this option you will not have <a href="filehandling.html#automatically_derive_buildfolders">auto derived build folders</a> after import, because no build folders will be created. 
	 
	<h5>Clean eclipse projects</h5>
	<p>
	When enabled a full <b>"clean all projects"</b> will be executed after import is done, so eclipse 
	bin folders will be recreated and eclipse and gradle outputs are in sync.
	</p>

	<h3 id="import_by_default">Import by standard eclipse way</h3>
	<p>
		This is the classic way if you do not want to use the EGradle importer mechanism.
	</p>
	<p>
		After <a href="setup.html">Setup</a> is done for your root project,
		you can use either
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>EGradles<a href="refresh_complete_workspace.html">
				refresh eclipse</a> dependencies button or
		</li>
		<li>use a console of your choice and call inside root project the
			gradle task "eclipse".</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		After this is done, use "File - import ... existing projects"
		inside eclipse and import all projects from root folder.</p>
