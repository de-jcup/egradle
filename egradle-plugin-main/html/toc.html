	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>EGradle is a lightweight gradle integration for eclipse which
		includes junit integration, launching, etc. and also a very feature
		rich editor.</p>
	<p>With Version 2.0 the editor was refactored and enabled to work
		standalone. So if you use another gradle integration for eclipse but
		you want to use the EGradle editor you can now install EGradle
		editor from eclipse market place instead of full EGradle IDE. Of
		course the editor is still an integrated part of EGradle IDE.</p>
	<p>
		More information about EGradle IDE can be found inside <a
			href="user_guide.html">user guide</a>. There exists also a <a

			playlist at YouTube</a>. If you have only installed the editor you should
		only look at <a href="user_guide/editor.html">this</a> page.

	<h2>Why EGradle?</h2>
	<p>
		There are other gradle integrations for eclipse (Gradle IDE,
		Buildship, ...).<br /> So why just another one? EGradle does it in
		another way than other integrations:
	<ul>
		<li>Console world and eclipse are same: <br>No compulsion to
			special import way. There exists an EGradle importer, but a simple
			"gradle eclipse" + "Import existing projects" will always work too!
		<li>Fast and simple to use</li>
		<li>A simple bridge between eclipse and gradle.</li>
		<li>No magic, only convenient gradle calling</li>
		<li>Very feature rich editor included</li>
	</ul>
