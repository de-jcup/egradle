<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
EGradle is a lightweight gradle integration for eclipse.
</p>
<p>
More information can be found inside <a href="user_guide.html">user guide</a>.
</p>
<h2>Why egradle?</h2>
<p>
There are other gradle integrations for eclipse (Gradle IDE, Buildship, ...).<br/> So why just another one? EGradle does it in another way than other integrations:
<ul>
<li>Console world and eclipse are same: <br>No compulsion to special import way. A simple "gradle eclipse" + "Import existing projects" will always work. 
<li>It shall be a simple bridge between eclipse and gradle.</li>
<li>It has to be fast and simple to use</li>
<li>It shall be comfortable and save time</li>
</ul>
