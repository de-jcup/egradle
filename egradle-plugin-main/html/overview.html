<h1>Overview</h1>
EGradle is a lightweight gradle integration for eclipse
More information can be found inside <a href="user_guide.html">user guide</a>.

<h2>Why egradle?</h2>
<p>
There are other gradle integrations for eclipse (Gradle IDE, Buildship, ...).<br/> So why just another one? EGradle does it in another way than other integrations:
<ul>
<li>Console world and eclipse are same: <br/><i>No special imports necessary, no additional classpath behaviours, eclipse natures etc. Just plain gradle usage.</i></li>
<li>EGradle ist more or less only a simple UI wrapper for gradle with some extra functions.</li>
<li>It shall be a simple bridge between eclipse and gradle.</li>
<li>It has to be fast and simple to use</li>
</ul>
