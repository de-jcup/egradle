		contains type override data where delegationTarget is set manually. Will be merged in loaded results and always override settings
		Data should be merged before any child delegation target calculation is done, so its enough to set information on an interface 
		so childs delegation target can be calculated by SDK builder. reduces override settings
		
		A typical approach is to scan for @groovy.lang.DelegatesTo inside gradle sources and do it manually here. This annotation is - currently - not often used, and
		as long as EGradle does not startup Gradle binary and does a runtime analysis of classes (or ASM scannig) this is a very lightweight approach
		to markup missing parts.
