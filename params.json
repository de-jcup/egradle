So why just another one?\r\nEGradle does it in another way than other integrations:\r\n- Console world and Eclipse world are same.\r\nNo special imports necessary, no additional classpath behaviours, eclipse natures etc. Just plain gradle usage. Your are always able to call gradle with \"cleanEclipse eclipse\" and import the generated eclipse project descriptons\r\n- EGradle ist more or less a simple UI wrapper for gradle with some extra functions.\r\n- It is a bridge between eclipse and console but the main logic is still inside gradle\r\n- No trying to parse/analyze gradle scripts. If you want to know which task you can execute please call \"tasks\" by quick launch\r\n- Reusing existing views, concepts and integrations - e.g. Junit test results are shown in Junit View\r\n- Uses KISS pattern (keep it simple stupid) in conjuction with being fast and comfortable\r\n\r\n## What are the features of EGradle?\r\nPlease look into [Features overview](https://github.com/de-jcup/egradle/wiki/Features#overview-of-egradle-features).\r\nMore information can be found inside [Wiki](https://github.com/de-jcup/egradle/wiki).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nEGradle is under Apache 2.0 license (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n",
